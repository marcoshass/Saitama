# README #

This project is an assignment that I built some time ago, my work style is similar to what is seen here.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This project is a typical iOS app that uses a rest service. All the calls are made over mock services.

### How do I get set up? ###

* You will need a Mac (I'm using El Capitan) and Xcode 8+.
